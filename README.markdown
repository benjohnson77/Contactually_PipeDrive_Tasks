##Contactually & PipeDrive Importer Tasks

###This is a couple of rake tasks for connecting to pipedrive and contacually for importing contact data in csv. 

I needed to assign contacts to a group of contacts so that they could use these tools for only their own accounts.   

1. Bundle Install 

2. Update CSV with the recommended format

3. rake contactually:import


This was for a specific use case, so milage may vary.
